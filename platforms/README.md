# Platform-Specific Configs

This folder contains platform-specific notes and configs.

## Structure
- `mac/` - Notes specific to macOS instances
- `linux/` - Notes specific to Hetzner/Linux instances

## Important
The actual Clawdbot config (`~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`) should NOT be in Git.
Keep tokens and sensitive configs local to each machine.

These folders are for:
- Platform-specific tool notes
- Setup instructions
- Non-sensitive customizations
